# Graphics Programming with SDL and Golang

In this project I want to learn graphics programming with SDL2 and Golang.
I chose Golang because it is a language that compiles to nearly every platform.
Furthermore, I am familiar with Golang and it is a very productive language.
As soon as I have understood more about graphics programming I want to explore what lower level
concepts are important with the use of the Zig programming language.
The repo will have multiple games and simulations first I will start with a snake game.
In addition to the graphics programming I want to explore Jujutsu for version control the technical
world is not standing still and want to try new things to see if the grass is greener on the other
side.

## TODO

- [x] border collision and loss
- [x] spawning apples and increasing length of snake
- [ ] make two stages -> startscreen & game screens

## Snake Game

The basic rules of the snake game are:

1. **Move the snake** using arrow keys.
2. **Eat food** to grow longer.
3. Avoid **hitting walls** or the snake's own body.
4. The game **ends** if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.
